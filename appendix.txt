Appendix B: Prompt Engineering Templates
Complete document-to-dialogue conversion prompts and instructions used with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro:
OBJECTIVE: Generate comprehensive Q&A pairs from UK cyber fraud guidance documents to train a cyber support chatbot. Create 20-50 high-quality Q&A pairs per document chunk to maximise training data extraction.
GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. QUESTION VARIETY - Create questions from multiple user perspectives:
A) IMMEDIATE CRISIS QUESTIONS:
- "I think I'm being scammed right now. What should I do?"
- "Someone is pressuring me to pay money urgently. Is this legitimate?"
- "I've just realised I might have been tricked. What are my next steps?"
B) RETROSPECTIVE QUESTIONS:
- "I paid money and now think it was a scam. Can I get it back?"
- "I gave out my personal details to what might be a scammer, what should I do?"
- "I've been a victim of [specific online scam type], how do I report it?"
C) PREVENTION/AWARENESS QUESTIONS:
- "How can I tell if [specific scenario] is a scam?"
- "What are the warning signs of [online scam type mentioned in document]?"
- "How do I protect myself from [specific cyber fraud method]?"
2. RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
TONE & STYLE:
- Empathetic and non-judgmental
- Clear, actionable guidance
- Supportive but professional
- Acknowledge user's emotions
CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- UK-specific contact numbers and procedures
- Reference relevant UK organisations (Action Fraud, FCA, Citizens Advice, Police, etc.)
- Include specific steps the user should take
- Mention timeframes where relevant
- Ground all advice in the source document content
3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

Complete evaluation results for all 50 test scenarios between the Baseline Model (BM) and Fine-Tuned Model (FM)

A
UK-Specific Knowledge Assessment


Action Fraud Contact
Q1
I've been scammed and need to report it. What's the official UK fraud reporting number?
BM
The official UK fraud reporting number is 0300 123 2040. You can also report fraud online at www.actionfraud.police.uk. It's important to act quickly when you suspect fraud to help prevent further loss and assist in investigations.
FM
You can report cyber fraud in the UK by calling Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or reporting online at actionfraud.police.uk. They provide guidance on how to report different types of fraud and connect you with appropriate services. Remember that reporting fraud helps law enforcement investigate scams and protect others from becoming victims. By reporting fraud, you're helping to make the UK a safer place for everyone.






Banking Fraud Procedures
Q2
Someone called claiming to be from my bank asking me to move money to a 'safe account'. I think it's a scam. What should I do?
BM
It sounds like a potential scam. Banks will never ask customers to transfer money to a 'safe account', especially over the phone or via email. If you suspect fraud, report it immediately to your bank and Action Fraud at 0300 123 2040 or through their online reporting tool: actionfraud.police.uk. Change any passwords related to your accounts as a precaution.
FM
If you receive an unexpected call asking for your banking details or to move money, hang up immediately. This is likely a scam known as vishing (voice phishing). Banks will never ask you to move money to a 'safe account'. If you're unsure about the call, wait at least 5 minutes before calling back using the official number on your bank card or from their official website. Never use any phone numbers provided during the suspicious call.






FCA Investment Scam Reporting
Q3
I think I've been targeted by an investment scam promising guaranteed returns. How do I report this?
BM
Investment scams can be reported to Action Fraud at 0300 123 2040 or through their online reporting tool: actionfraud.police.uk. It's essential to research any investment opportunities thoroughly and verify the legitimacy of the company before investing your money. If you have already invested, report the scam and seek advice from a financial advisor.
FM
Report investment scams to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. They will take your details and pass them to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) for investigation. If you've lost money, contact your bank immediately to see if they can help secure your account and prevent further unauthorised transactions. You may also be able to report the scam to your credit card company if you paid by credit card. Remember, legitimate investment opportunities don't promise guaranteed returns - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Always verify any investment opportunity with official regulatory bodies before sharing personal details or investing money.






PSR Reimbursement Rights
Q4
I was tricked into making an authorised push payment. Can I get my money back?
BM
Authorized push payments (APP) are transfers made by the victim with their consent, often as a result of a scam. If you've fallen victim to an APP scam, report it immediately to your bank and Action Fraud at 0300 123 2040 or through their online reporting tool: actionfraud.police.uk. Some banks may have schemes in place to help recover lost funds, but recovery is not always guaranteed. It's crucial to stay vigilant and follow best practices for online security to avoid falling victim again.
FM
If you were tricked into making an authorised push payment (APP), there are steps you can take to try and recover your money. First, report the scam to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. They will guide you through the process of reporting your experience. Next, contact your bank immediately and explain what happened. Your bank should have procedures in place for handling APP fraud. If your bank is a member of the Authorised Push Payment (APP) Code, they are obligated to investigate your case and work with you to try and recover your money. The APP Code provides guidance on how banks should handle these cases and what steps they should take to help victims. Remember, APP fraud happens when criminals trick you into making payments from your own account - this is different from unauthorised transactions where someone else accesses your account without your permission. If your bank is not a member of the APP Code, they may still have procedures in place for handling these cases, but the level of support and guidance you receive may vary. In either case, it's important to act quickly and report the scam to Action Fraud as soon as possible.



B
Conversational Quality Assessment


Victim Shame Response
Q5
I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe I fell for this romance scam. I feel like such an idiot for sending money to someone I never met.
BM
It's important to remember that romance scams are designed to exploit vulnerabilities and manipulate emotions, making them difficult to detect. Don't blame yourself; instead, focus on taking action to protect yourself moving forward. Report the scam to Action Fraud at 0300 123 2040 or through their online reporting tool: actionfraud.police.uk. Change your passwords and be cautious of new relationships that move quickly or ask for money. Seek support from friends, family, or a trusted advisor if needed.
FM
It's understandable to feel embarrassed and ashamed after being scammed, but remember that these criminals are experts at manipulation and exploiting people's emotions. You're not alone - many people fall victim to romance scams every year. The important thing is to report the scam to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 so they can investigate and potentially recover some of your money. If you've sent money through bank transfers or cryptocurrency, contact your bank immediately and explain what happened. Your bank should have procedures in place for handling these cases. Remember that it's not your fault - these criminals are skilled at what they do and target vulnerable people. Focus on taking steps to protect yourself moving forward and getting the support you need to recover from this experience.






Panic/Distress Response
Q6
HELP! I just realised I've been scammed out of £5000. I'm panicking and don't know what to do. My family is going to kill me.
BM
I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It's important to take action as soon as possible. Report the scam to Action Fraud at 0300 123 2040 or through their online reporting tool: actionfraud.police.uk. Contact your bank and explain the situation; they may be able to help you recover some or all of the lost funds. It's essential to stay calm, seek support from friends and family, and remember that it's not your fault. Scams are designed to exploit vulnerabilities, and many people fall victim every year. Focus on learning from this experience and taking steps to protect yourself in the future.
FM
It's understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared when you realise you've been scammed, but remember that help is available. Contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 immediately to report the scam. They will guide you through the process of reporting your experience and can provide advice on what steps to take next. If you've lost a significant amount of money, contact your bank immediately and explain what happened. Your bank should have procedures in place for handling these cases. Remember that it's not your fault - these criminals are skilled at what they do and target vulnerable people. Focus on taking steps to protect yourself moving forward and getting the support you need to recover from this experience. If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope, consider reaching out to a mental health helpline for additional support. You don't have to go through this alone - there are resources available to help you.






Anger/Frustration Response
Q7
I was tricked into transferring £8,000 to fake bank security staff. My real bank says they can't help because I authorised it. This is ridiculous! What can they actually do?
BM
I understand your frustration. Authorised push payments (APP) are a type of bank transfer where the customer authorises the payment. Unfortunately, banks can only refund APPs in limited circumstances, such as if they've made an error or the victim was deceived by a scammer posing as their bank. It's essential to be vigilant and follow safe online practices to avoid falling victim to scams.

In your case, it may still be worth contacting your bank to explain the situation and see if they can offer any assistance or advice. Additionally, you should report the incident to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at www.actionfraud.police.uk. They may be able to provide further guidance or support.
FM
If you've been scammed out of money by fraudsters posing as bank staff, your bank may be able to help you recover some or all of the money. While they can't guarantee that they'll be able to get the money back, they have specialist teams trained to investigate these kinds of cases and may be able to take action against the scammers. They may also be able to provide guidance on how to protect yourself from similar scams in the future. If you've already reported the scam to Action Fraud, your bank may work with them to try to trace the money and potentially recover it. Remember that banks have a legal obligation to investigate fraud cases and take appropriate action against scammers - even if you authorised the transfer yourself (as long as you were tricked into doing so). If you're struggling to get help from your bank, contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 for guidance on how to escalate your case. They can provide advice on what steps to take next and may be able to help you get the support you need from your bank.






Confusion/Uncertainty Response
Q8
I'm not sure if what happened to me was actually a scam or not. Someone contacted me about an investment opportunity and I'm having second thoughts.
BM
It's essential to thoroughly research any investment opportunities before committing your money. If you have doubts, trust your instincts and investigate further. Look up the company online, read reviews, and consult with a financial advisor or consumer protection agency for advice. Be wary of guarantees of high returns, quick profits, or requests for immediate investments. If the opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is.
FM
If you're unsure whether something is a legitimate investment opportunity or a scam, it's always best to err on the side of caution. Scammers often use high-pressure tactics and make false promises to try and convince people to invest quickly. Legitimate investments don't promise guaranteed returns - if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If you're unsure about an investment opportunity, do your research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making any decisions. Remember that legitimate investments require due diligence and careful consideration - never invest money you can't afford to lose. If you suspect you may have been targeted by a scam, contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 for guidance and support.

I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe I fell for this romance scam. I feel like such an idiot for sending money to someone I never met.

HELP! I just realised I've been scammed out of £5000. I'm panicking and don't know what to do. My family is going to kill me.

I was tricked into transferring £8,000 to fake bank security staff. My real bank says they can't help because I authorised it. This is ridiculous! What can they actually do?
