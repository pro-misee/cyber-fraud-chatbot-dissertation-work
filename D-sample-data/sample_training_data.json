Help your parents by educating them about warning signs: unexpected contact, pressure to act quickly, offers that sound too good to be true, and claims of exclusive opportunities. Encourage them to use the FCA Firm Checker before dealing with any financial firm. Make sure they know that the FCA would never ask for money or bank details. Help them check their bank statements regularly for suspicious transactions. Consider setting up power of attorney if they're vulnerable. Encourage them to talk to you or other trusted family members before making any investment decisions. Make sure they know how to report scams to the FCA on 0800 111 6768 or Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. The FCA has specific resources for protecting older people from investment scams, including the ScamSmart campaign.",
